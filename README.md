# Hydroidolina Phylogeny Assignment

In this assignment you will reanalyze the data from the following paper:

> Cartwright, P., Evans, N. M., Dunn, C. W., Marques, A. C., Miglietta, M. P., 
Schuchert, P., & Collins, A. G. (2008). Phylogenetics of Hydroidolina 
(Hydrozoa: Cnidaria). Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the UK, 
88(08), 1663-1672. 
[doi:10.1017/S0025315408002257](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315408002257)

Take a look at the paper to familiarize yourself with the problem at hand, the 
approach taken, the data used, and the analyses that are presented.

Below are a series of analyses to perform with these data. As with many analyses, most of the hands-on work is data wrangling (getting files organized and in the right format). New ground that we cover here includes:

- Batch download of data from NCBI
- Reformatting sequence names
- Multiple sequence alignment
- Combining data from multiple genes into a single alignment
- Running multiple analyses

## Steps

Some of the steps below build on things you already did in the [siphonophore16s](https://github.com/Phylogenetics-Brown-BIOL1425/siphonophore16s) analysis. Check that repository if you are unsure about details here.


### Fork the repository on github

Browse to the GitHub repository for this exercise. If you are reading this at GitHub, you are already [there](https://github.com/Phylogenetics-Brown-BIOL1425/hydroidolina).

Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the page. This creates your own independent copy of the repository to work with, so we can all make changes without affecting other peoples' analyses. It also takes you to the web page for the new repository. The url will be something like:

    https://github.com/github_username/hydroidolina

where `github_username` is your github username.


### Download and prepare the data

Clone the repository to your laptop.

Table 1 of the paper presents the [NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) accession 
numbers for all the data included in the analyses. I have extracted the data 
from Table 1 and are presented here in three files (I also cleaned up a couple 
of typos in the accession numbers):

    28s.txt
    18s.txt
    16s.txt
    
Use the 
[NCBI Batch Entrez interface](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/batchentrez) 
to download a fasta file for the sequences listed in each of these three files. 
From the top of the interface, select the 'Nucleotide' Database and chose a file 
of accession numbers. Click retrieve, and then follow the link that is generated. 
This will take you to a page with the sequence summaries. Click 'Send to', 
choose 'File' as the destination, 'FASTA' as the format, and then click 
'Create File'.

Repeat this for each of the three gene files, rename them `28s.raw.fasta` etc. 

The fasta header rows (which start with `>`) have lots of information. To combine data across genes we will need the header to just have the species name. Use regular expressions (see Haddock and Dunn chapters 2-3), a powerful and flexible search and replace tool, to make these changes with the `sed` command:

    sed -E 's/>.+\| ([a-zA-Z]+) ([a-zA-Z]+)[\. ].+/>\1_\2/g' 28s.raw.fasta > 28s.fasta
    sed -E 's/>.+\| ([a-zA-Z]+) ([a-zA-Z]+)[\. ].+/>\1_\2/g' 18s.raw.fasta > 18s.fasta
    sed -E 's/>.+\| ([a-zA-Z]+) ([a-zA-Z]+)[\. ].+/>\1_\2/g' 16s.raw.fasta > 16s.fasta

The basic format of each of these commands is `sed -E 's/search/replace/g' input_file > output_file` where search this the text it is looking for and replace is the text that it puts in its place.


Then add the fasta files to the repository, commit, and push them:

   git add *.fasta
   git commit -am "added raw fasta files"
   git push


### Generate alignments

In the raw fasta files, homologous sites are not in the same columns because the sequences start in different places, and there have been insertions and deletions in the course of sequence evolution. Aligners attempt to place homologous sites in the same columns by inserting gaps (usually denoted with the `-` character) to create a data matrix. We'll use the aligner `mafft`. You can clone the respository to your oscar `~/scratch` directory and make the alignments there, or [download mafft](http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) and install it on your own computer.

  interact # only needed on oscar, starts an interactive analysis session
  module load mafft # only needed on oscar, loads the mafft module

  mafft 28s.fasta > 28s.aligned.fasta
  mafft 18s.fasta > 18s.aligned.fasta
  mafft 16s.fasta > 16s.aligned.fasta

  git add *aligned.fasta
  git commit -am "added alignments"
  git push

Unfortunately, there are many different alignment formats formats and different programs use different formats `mafft` creates alignments in fasta format, but we'll need them in phylip and nexus format for phylogenetic analyses. We also need to create combined matrices that include data from all genes. There are many scripts available online for these tasks, but we will just use the interactive tool [mesquite](http://mesquiteproject.org/) on your laptop.

For each of the `*.aligned.fasta` files, do the following. These example steps are for `28s.aligned.fasta`:

- Open `28s.aligned.fasta` in mesquite. It will ask you to save the alignment as a nexus file, save it as `28s.nex`.
- Once the file is open, go to the File menu and select Export. Then select "Phylip (DNA/RNA)". In the window that pops up, leave "Interleave matrix" unchecked, change the "Maximum length of taxon names" to 50, and set "End of line character" to "Unix (LF)". Click Export and save as `28s.phy`.
- Take a look at the alignment to see how it did. Make sure that all the sequences are in the same 
direction (if a sequence is in a different direction, it won't line up with the 
others) and that there are no other conspicuous problems. If some sequences 
are in the wrong direction, copy the original fasta file, replace the 
offending sequences with their reverse compliments (you can generate the 
reverse compliment with one of many online tools, such as 
[this one](http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/rev_comp.html)). Then realign the 
file with mafft and inspect it again.
- Close the file (you can hit "Don't save" since everything is saved already).


You should now have five files for each gene, eg `28s.raw.fasta`, `28s.fasta`, `28s.aligned.fasta`, `28s.nex` and `28s.phy`.

Questions:

1. Based on eye-balling the alignments, do you think that each gene has a 
   consistent rate of molecular evolution along its full length?

No, the rate of evolution along the genes is dependent on position. There are regions of the genes that are highly conserved among most or all of the species represented in the study, but there are also highly variable regions in which mutation has occurred more frequently.

2. Based on eye-balling the alignments, which gene (16S, 18S, or 28S) do you think has 
   the fastest average rate of molecular evolution? The slowest?

At first pass, the 16s gene appears to have undergone the most evolution, and the 28s gene appears to have undergone the least.

### Create concatenated alignments

Now you have alignments for three genes. We will combine the data by creating concatenated alignments that include data for all genes. There are a few ways to do this, we'll use the tool [phyutility](https://github.com/blackrim/phyutility). If you don't have java installed already, you will need to install it (if you try the command below but don't have java, it may describe how to install java on your system). Rather than install java on your laptop, you could just run the command on oscar (which has java installed already)

Execute the following line to create the combined analysis:

    java -jar phyutility.jar -concat -in 16s.aligned.fasta 18s.aligned.fasta 28s.aligned.fasta -out combined.nex

This will create a new nexus file that has data from all three genes. Data are combined in the same row for sequences with the same species names.

You still need to export the file as a phylip file. Open `combined.nex` in Mesquite. Open the "File" menu and select "Export". Then select "Phylip (DNA/RNA)". In the window that pops up, leave "Interleave matrix" unchecked, change the "Maximum length of taxon names" to 50, and set "End of line character" to "Unix (LF)". Click Export and save as `combined.phy`.

Now that you have all your alignment files, go ahead and commit them:

    git add *.nex *.phy
    git commit -am "generated nexus and phylip alignment files"
    git push

### Maximum likelihood analyses

The `raxml.sh` file contains the start of the code for running the analyses. It has lines for the combined and 16s analyses, go ahead and add lines for the 18s and 28s analyses by copying and modifying the 16s line. There are two fields that need to be modified: the name if the input file (specified by `-s`) and the base of the name for the output files (specified with `-n`).

Note that the run time is 24 hours, longer than we used in the previous siphonophore16s analyses. That is because we are analyzing 4 matrices, which will take a bit longer. This script uses 8 CPU cores (specified by `#SBATCH --nodes=1`, `#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=8`, and `mpirun -n 8`) for each raxml command, but doesn't launch a command until the commands before it finish.

Once you have updated the `raxml.sh` file, push the changes:

    git commit -am "added 18s and 28s commands to raxml batch file"
    git push

Log in to oscar, `cd` to the `~/scratch/hydroidolina` repository directory (you will need to clone it to scratch if you haven't already), and then pull changes and launch the run:

    git pull
    sbatch raxml.sh 

Once the run is complete (you can check the status with `myq`), add the new files to the git repository, push them to github, pull them to your laptop, and take a look at the results.

Questions:

1. Do the trees differ from those published? If so, how?

Looking at the combined best tree and comparing it to the trees published in the paper, the most obvious difference is in the topology. There are two taxa in the best combined tree that are grouped separately from all the rest, while in the published tree there is more clustering. Furthermore, there are specific differences between clustering on the published tree and the combined best tree. For example, in the combined tree, *Zyzzyzus calderi* and *Ralpharia gorgoniae* are placed together in their own clade with aency score of 98. However, in the best combined tree, they are slightly more distant, sharing a clade with *Zyzzyzus warreni* and *Ectopleura dumortieri*.

2. How do the trees for each gene differ from each other?

One major difference is in branch length. While the 18s and 28s trees seem to agree somewhat for any given taxon, the 16s tree shows a marked difference in branch lengths: an egregious example is *Hippodius hippopus*, which has the distinction of possessing the longest branch on the 16s best tree, but rather short branches on the 18s and 28s trees. Another difference is that some species are not represented on all trees: *Zyzzyzus calderi* is only represented on the 28s tree, though the related *Zyzzyzus warreni* is found on all three.

3. Take a look at the raxml log files. What do these tell you about the 
   different models of molecular evolution for the four analyses?

Each tree analysis had to use different parameters to explain sequence variation, most visibly in their alphas and rates of base interconversion. However, these parameters appear to fall into similar ratios within each gene. The implication is that each has undergone differing rates of evolution, though the mechanism of evolution seems to be somewhat conserved. For example, in order to explain the data for the 16s gene, the rate of pyrimidine interconversion is more than eleven times higher than a basal rate of 1.0. In the other genes, this rate is much lower, but still the largest rate for every gene. In fact, for nearly every rate constant the 16s data requires higher values than the 18s and 28s data, suggesting that evolution is proceeding more rapidly on that gene. An exception may be seen in the C to G interconversion rate, which is roughly similar (and low) in every gene. It is then clear that pyrimidine interconversion is the most prevalent type of mutation acting on the genes, and that evolution acts more quickly on the 16s sequence.
